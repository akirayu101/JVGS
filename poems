Our story takes place
when all we know is mostly gone
an emptiness without any grace
but still, a poet lingers on

When all is gone, where will you go
in a place where trees no longer grow
a stream of thoughts is all that's left
of our world we were bereft
and amongst a world of ruins and demolition
travels a lone poet with no mission

Shards of broken glass
All my memories are gone
Where do I begin?

Have I been here before?
I don't know it anymore.

Is this new world my own creation
a part of my sick imagination

The further I go, the less I know.

My sight is going as the color fades away
I'm terribly missing the colors of day
I'm looking for any kind of way
Where I can get myself out of the fray

You're so vein
you probably think this game is about you
don't you
don't you

Looking for my memories
fading out, dying melodies
Last thing I remember
dull day in december
need to get a grip on myself and then
what was I looking for again?

the trees have dropped their last leaves
and a bird cries out of despair
a mountain sighs, because he believes
he'll soon fade into the air
we don't deserve any better
but I'm glad we fade away together

remembers me of a game i used to play
used to help me through the day
now all that has gone away
and these times
i just have my poems and my rhymes
