Our story takes place
when all we know is mostly gone
an emptiness without any grace
but still, a poet lingers on

When all is gone, where will you go
in a place where trees no longer grow
a stream of thoughts is all that's left
of our world we were bereft
and amongst a world of ruins and demolition
travels a lone poet with no mission

Shards of broken glass
All my memories are gone
Where do I begin?

Have I been here before?
I don't know it anymore.

Is this new world my own creation
a part of my sick imagination

The further I go, the less I know.

My sight is going as the color fades away
I'm terribly missing the colors of day
I'm looking for any kind of way
Where I can get myself out of the fray

You're so vein
you probably think this game is about you
don't you
don't you

Looking for my memories
fading out, dying melodies
Last thing I remember
dull day in december
need to get a grip on myself and then
what was I looking for again?

the trees have dropped their last leaves
and a bird cries out of despair
a mountain sighs, because he believes
he'll soon fade into the air
that being said
you could be something in my head
I don't deserve any better
but I'm glad we fade away together

remembers me of a game i used to play
used to help me through the day
now all that has gone away
and in these times
i just have my poems and my rhymes

since it all begun
I've always been on the run
trying not to look back
because then I could crack

my world is black and white 
not the slightest change in sight

staring at the sea
I have these thoughts in me
does the ocean take us all
erase us when we fall

for all the times
I could resist it all
I had my rhymes
I had my wall
Now see the irony
I've been torn to pieces
by no one else but me

As I dream of birds
I dream of being free
I only have these words
Maybe they will dream for me

Every planet I see is dead
perhaps
I just see them in my head

I look up at the nightly skies
feel the rain on my face
the dark sky never lies
such a lovely place

Things all fading away
I don't deserve any better
If I had something to say
It wouldn't really matter
