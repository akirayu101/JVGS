Our story takes place
when all we know is mostly gone
an emptiness without any grace
but still, a poet lingers on

Shards of broken glass
All my memories are gone
Where do I begin?

My sight is going as the color fades away
I'm terribly missing the colors of day
I'm looking for any kind of way
Where I can get myself out of the fray

You're so vein
you probably think this game is about you
don't you
don't you

Looking for my memories
fading out, dying melodies
Last thing I remember
dull day in december
need to get a grip on myself and then
what was I looking for again?
