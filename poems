Our story takes place
when all we know is mostly gone
an emptiness without any grace
but still, a poet lingers on

Shards of broken glass
All my memories are gone
Where do I begin?

My sight is going as the color fades away
I'm terribly missing the colors of day
I'm looking for any kind of way
Where I can get myself out of the fray

You're so vein
you probably think this game is about you
don't you
don't you
